What are Web Stories? In this post jdhjkshfjkdhfjkdh kjdhjk

This means that any important information or keywords in the text won’t be indexed or searchable by search engines, which can negatively affect SEO. The presence of a mobile version of the site is one of the main requirements that search engines place on the quality of sites. [^abbr1]

However, creating complex and intricate designs using only code can be challenging, as it requires a skill set and creativity that not everyone possesses. Designing visually compelling content through code is truly an art form.

{{< img class="fixed-height-container center" caption="Lockup  titles are easy to read." src="images/lockup.png" width="676" height="449"   >}}




The challenge we’re addressing here is known as "Lockup Design." This design concept refers to combining text and graphics in a way that the elements are harmonized and work together cohesively.
Lockup design is highly effective, especially when you need to fit a long title within a confined space. 


{{< img class="fixed-height-container center" caption="  Lockup  titles are easy to read.   " src="images/youtube.PNG" width="676" height="449"   >}}

Lockup design is particularly popular among YouTube cover designers.  Given the character limit for titles on the platform, designers often face the challenge of fitting lengthy text into a restricted area while maintaining a visually appealing layout.

{{< img class="fixed-height-container left" caption="  Lockup  titles are easy to read.   " src="images/caption.gif" width="676" height="449"   >}}

However, YouTube designers don’t need to worry about making captions indexed or responsive. But when it comes to mobile screens, web stories come into play. An ideal solution would be to replicate lockup captions created in graphics into code. 

Are we doing it yet? The answer is: not yet. Even in graphic design, lockup design is already a challenge for YouTube designers, but lockup design for stories takes it to the next level. It’s a very time-consuming task, but it’s definitely doable. Thanks to the dev community and [those](https://css-tricks.com/author/geoffgraham/) who share their techniques.

Somewhere in the middle of the markdown document:

This is a normal footnote, which directs to the bottom of the document. [^1]
This is a dual footnote, which also reuses the url from the footnote for a hyperlink [more on markdown] [AG] [^2]

At the bottom om the document:

[^1]: Here goes the normal footnote, which is used inside the text above.
[^2]: And here the dual footnote, which beside the footnote (link to the bottom) also contains a link out of document including text mouseover (optional).
