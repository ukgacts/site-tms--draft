1 ) Web stories appear directly in Google search results, meaning they can be indexed and easily found. 


{{< img class="fixed-height-container width-80 center " caption="web stories can be indexed by search engines like Google, making them searchable and accessible to anyone on the internet." src="images/search2.jpg" width="449" height="227"   >}}



In contrast, social media stories are limited to users within the specific network that allows them to create stories, making them less widely accessible.

{{< img class="fixed-height-container center width-40 " caption="Searching for a story on Instagram is quite different from searching for a web story on Google. On Instagram, stories are only visible to users who follow the account or are part of the network, and there isnâ€™t an easy way to search for specific stories." src="images/serach.jpg" width="185" height="158"   >}}


2)	There is no expiration date for web stories. Only the owners of web stories decide how long they will last and be stored. Instagram, for example, has a limit: the duration of stories is 60 seconds and their lifespan is only 24 hours. 


{{< img class="fixed-height-container center width-80 " caption="Instagram stories disappear after 24 hours. Unlike web stories, which remain accessible and searchable over time." src="images/time.jpg" width="468" height="167"   >}}


3)	Links and CTA buttons can be used in web stories. On Instagram, including links is only available to the users who have more than ten thousand subscribers. 

4) Unlike social media stories, when you include ads in your Web Stories, 100% of ads   revenue goes to you.
