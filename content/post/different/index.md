We believe storytelling is an art form that technology cannot replace. There is no substitute for talented copywriting, professional video and audio mastering.

 We are well-versed in British DJ culture and current trends in sound and video design. The software we use for creating, compressing video and audio, adding different media embeds  cannot be implemented by any automatic story or site builders. But even if it were technically possible, using this professional software would be very  expensive and  difficult to use  without special training 

## How else do we differ from automatic story builders? 


 One of the main drawbacks of no-code development platforms is the risk of vendor lock-in. A vendor lock-in occurs when an organization relies heavily on a single vendor's technologies, making it challenging to move to another platform. For example, the famous case with Parler1, which relied on AWS, was shut down due to vendor lock-in, rendering them unable to migrate away.
 Writing, organizing, and laying out your story takes considerable time. However, when using an automatic story builder, you do not completely own your story. Exporting or transferring your story to another platform built with an automatic story builder can be incredibly difficult, and often impossible.


In contrast, our clients can host their stories wherever they want. Everything needed to run the story lives in one folder, with no database,  and zero code dependencies. 
 

Content Suspension Risks:
 Potential Plan Limitations
Automatic story builders  may limit the number of slides a story can have and restrict storage based on your plan. Exceeding the limits of a free plan? for example, can result in the suspension of your content, with the possibility of losing your data permanently after a single warning. These limitations can severely restrict the amount of information and visual appeal you can present in your story.


In contrast, our clients stories have no expiration date. After you get your story, you can store it in your computer and forget about it for  10 years. After  10 years  when you open it the story will be absolutely the same. There is no need to update the software or database. Our clients control their data 100%.


2. Fully Customized Design and No Restricted Features

 if you have a specific vision, you might get frustrated with the limited options and features that story builders can offer. 
 We  can create or customize any design template and there are no restricted features for us. They  use generic templates, resulting in similar structures, layouts, and styles for all stories. This lack of customization can prevent your story from standing out and hinder brand building.

For example, some components of the AMP framework have an experimental status. That means they are not available in  automatic  builders toolsetst and  cannot be used by wide audience. But for us it is a different story. We work directly with code and as soon as Google releases new features, we can implement them straight away. 


The  list of experimental features can be found here.

A good example is soundcloud



To sum up, trust us to tell your story and be sure it will be unique and very visual appealing. For instance, here is a short example of the video we made for the story..Do you remeber it is only 15 secs length? Robbie Williams looks good because we are good at video making







. Poor Google Rankings & SEO
Google prefers web pages that are well-organized, which is often not the case with automatic builders. Auto builders are notorious for their messy and unstructured codes, which can damage SEO and negatively impact your story's visibility and ranking on Google. Additionally, most story builders do not integrate with Google Analytics, depriving clients of important performance data.
