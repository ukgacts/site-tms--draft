Photoshop has long been the go-to software for creating visually stunning cover images. While these images can be trendy and appealing, one major limitation is that search engines cannot read text embedded in images.

This means that any important information or keywords in the text won’t be indexed or searchable by search engines, which can negatively affect SEO.
However, creating complex and intricate designs using only code can be challenging, as it requires a skill set and creativity that not everyone possesses. Designing visually compelling content through code is truly an art form.

The challenge we’re addressing here is known as "Lockup Design." This design concept refers to combining text and graphics in a way that the elements are harmonized and work together cohesively.
Lockup design is highly effective, especially when you need to fit a long title within a confined space.

Lockup design is particularly popular among YouTube cover designers.  Given the character limit for titles on the platform, designers often face the challenge of fitting lengthy text into a restricted area while maintaining a visually appealing layout.

However, YouTube designers don’t need to worry about making captions indexed or responsive. But when it comes to mobile screens, web stories come into play. An ideal solution would be to replicate lockup captions created in graphics into code. 

Are we doing it yet? The answer is: not yet. Even in graphic design, lockup design is already a challenge for YouTube designers, but lockup design for stories takes it to the next level. It’s a very time-consuming task, but it’s definitely doable. Thanks to the dev community and [those](https://css-tricks.com/author/geoffgraham/) who share their techniques.
