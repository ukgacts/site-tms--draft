Since Google announced the introduction of web stories in Google Search, many opportunities have opened up for businesses. 
In today’s fast-paced digital landscape, attention spans are shorter than ever, and Web Stories are designed to quickly capture viewers’ attention with short, easy-to-digest content. Web stories have the potential to revolutionize how news and journalism are presented online. Instead of just listing facts, web stories allow for a more natural integration of information.

But the main advantage of web stories isn’t just how information is presented, but their ability to play a key role in SEO. Unlike closed platforms like Instagram or Facebook, web stories are visible on search engines and can be discovered anywhere across the internet.

Google search results offer much more than just a list of links. They consist of various panels (SERP), including snippets, carousels, knowledge graphs, and cards. Every time we search for something, we don’t just see a list of links—instead, we encounter SERP panels at the top of the page. These spots are highly competitive, and not every site can secure one. However, for web stories, Google has made an exception by dedicating a special block just for them. By doing this, Google is clearly signaling its intention to widely promote and distribute web stories.
Currently, over 2,000 websites have published their web stories that have been indexed by Google.


One might wonder why Google gives such preference to web stories. The answer is simple and lies, in part, in the technology behind them.
Web stories are built on the AMP framework, a technology developed by Google. AMP gained popularity as a way to make websites faster, and the faster a site loads, the higher its ranking on Google. Google claims that AMP technology optimizes websites for speed, but the real secret behind AMP is how Google treats AMP pages differently. Whenever mobile search results feature AMP pages, Google starts preloading those pages before the user even visits them. On the other hand, for non-AMP pages, the loading process only begins once the user visits the page. As a result, there’s a noticeable speed difference between AMP and non-AMP pages.
Does this have anything to do with web stories?

Yes, web stories are built on AMP technology, which means they can also be pre-cached and, as a result, are  prioritized by Google.
