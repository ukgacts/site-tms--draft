    <h1> PulseFrames™ <br> Beyond the Swipe
</h1>

     <p>
  PulseFrames weren't born in a boardroom; they were born through international experimentation. Refined during our residency in the Finnish startup ecosystem and tested with partners like Pori Jazz and Prizz Tech, this system is the culmination of years of creative struggle and technical breakthrough.
We’ve done the research. We’ve built the engine. Now, we’re giving your brand the Pulse.

        <h3>The Journey</h3>

     

        <p>
          Born from our R&D phase in Finland and refined through work with Pori Jazz and Prizz Tech, PulseFrames are the result of merging Nordic technical precision with British creative soul.

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Social media stories disappear in 24 hours. Traditional websites are often static and cluttered.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="service-col">
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>
       The permanent, searchable alternative to social storytelling. Hand-coded stories that live on your domain, rank on Google, and engage users like an app.
