  Overview


Industry: Beauty & Wellness
Project Duration: 3 Months
Goal: Increase online sales and improve customer engagement

GlowSkin, a fast-growing organic skincare brand, was struggling with low online conversions despite strong social media engagement. They approached our team to redesign their website and optimize their customer journey.
    </p>
<p>The Challenge

Although GlowSkin had:

50K+ Instagram followers

Consistent traffic (15,000 monthly visitors)

High product ratings

They faced several problems:

1.2% conversion rate (below industry average)

High cart abandonment (78%)

Slow website speed (6+ seconds load time)

Confusing navigation and checkout process

The brand needed a seamless, mobile-friendly experience that reflected its premium identity.</p>

        “It’s not news that being a startup founder/CEO is a lonely,

        Jonathan and the Enjoy The Work team.”
